# Mood Track

Mood Track uses the Spotify API to read the user's most recent 5 songs and then recommends a song similar to the mood of those last 5 songs. The app also gives an option to search for the tracks if the user doesn't have a Spotify accout.

The app uses NodeJS with ExpressJS to handle the requests and Handlebars to handle the HTML rendering on the server.
